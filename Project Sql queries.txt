et's analyze the data to accomplish your tasks. First, I'll inspect the file you uploaded to understand its structure and the fields available.

The dataset contains 81 columns with various details about CO₂ emissions, population, GDP, and related metrics. The primary columns relevant to your tasks include:

country: Name of the country.
year: Year of the data.
total_co2_emission(including luc): Total CO₂ emissions including land use change.
coal_co2, gas_co2, oil_co2, cement_co2: Emissions by specific sectors.
region: Geographical region of the country.

Here is the SQL query to retrieve the top 10 countries with the highest emissions in the last decade, excluding aggregated groups like "World," "Asia," etc.:

SELECT 
    country,
    SUM(total_co2_emission) AS total_emissions
FROM 
    emissions_table
WHERE 
    year >= YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - 10 -- Adjust based on the current year
    AND country NOT IN ('World', 'Asia', 'Upper-middle-income countries', 
                        'High-income countries', 'North America', 'Europe', 
                        'Lower-middle-income countries', 'European Union (27)')
GROUP BY 
    country
ORDER BY 
    total_emissions DESC
LIMIT 10;


Here are the SQL queries for the remaining tasks:
